# Leetcode Solutions
My attempts at various leetcode problems.
They should all work but not necessarily the most optimally.
I use leetcode to practice C++, Kotlin, JavaScript, and Python 3.


### Very slow solutions (to fix later)
* binary-tree-cameras
* evaluate-reverse-polish-notation

### Language Features
* JavaScript - Used for the built-in hash.
* C++ - Used for pointers or bit manipulations.
* Kotlin - Used for functional programming (map, fold, reduce, flatmap) or StringBuilder/StringBuffer.
* Python3 - List comprehensions.
