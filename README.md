# Leetcode Solutions
My attempts at various leetcode problems.
They should all get accepted but they are not necessarily the most optimal.
I use leetcode to practice C++, Kotlin, JavaScript, and Python 3.


### Very slow solutions (to fix later)
* binary-tree-cameras
* evaluate-reverse-polish-notation
* merge-k-sorted-lists

### Language Features
* C++ - Necessary for pointers or bit manipulations. Containers numerous useful containers such as unordered_map.
* Kotlin - Used for functional programming (map, fold, reduce, flatmap).
* Python3 - Useful for list comprehensions and subarray operations.
